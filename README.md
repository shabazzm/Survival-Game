# Survival-Game

A text-based survival game, written in C++, created for OSU final project. The user plays as a survivor of  a plane crash and tries to reach safety. Along the way the user has survival events that will happen and locales they can explore. Some supplies gathered will be helpful, others will be crucial to final survival. 

This game is in need of  refactoring and having some code cleanup. It was coded over the span of a few days.
